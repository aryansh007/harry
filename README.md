#Assignment 1 (Assignment1.java "Uniform Cost Search")
This assignment is about the problem of 8 queens , and we solve this problem using **UCS algorithm**. In this algo , we start with a empty board and try to explore the each valid state. The code will find all the possible solution and print them. Here we consider the cost of every move is same equal to 1.
It does not contain any input file. It only has one output file name **Ass1_out.txt**.
To run this code copy the code and command to run the file is **javac filename.java** then **java filename** it will give you the output.

#Assignment 2(Assignment2.java "A* Algorithm")
This assignment is about the problem of 8 queens , and we solve this problem using **A*** algorithm. In this algo , we start with a empty board and try to explore the each valid state. The code will find all the possible solution and print them. Here we consider the cost of every move is same equal to 1.
Heurstic:-Number of pairs of Queens on board in attacking position
It does not contain any input file. It only has one output file name **Ass2_out.txt**.
To run this code copy the code and command to run the file is **javac filename.java** then **java filename** it will give you the output.

#Assignment 3(genetic.cpp "Genetic Algorithm")
It contains only one input number of students after that code will run upto 1000 generations and in each generation it will print the fittest member in the population. The output file is **genetic_out.txt** and it also contain input on the first line.
To run this code copy the code and command to run the file is **g++ filename.cpp** then **executable_filename.exe** it will give you **Enter the number of students** Enter the nuber you want and press Enter then the code will print the fittest member from the population and diversity of every group (**in this case we divide the students in 3 groups**) and this will run upto 1000 generations and at 1000th generation you will get the optimized solution.

#Assignment 4(Assignment4_minmaxGame.cpp "Alpha Beta Pruning")
The code is written fully in 1 file and covers all the three cases. It uses concept of alpha-beta prunning .
To run this code copy the code and command to run the file is **g++ filename.cpp** then **executable_filename.exe**. 

Description of  input file :-First it will ask you about the mode (i) two player mode (ii)one player (iii) Ai vs Ai. Then it ask you for the number of sticks.Then it tells you the rules of the game and who has won the toss.
After the toss it ask you about the number of sticks if you coose two player or one player mode.
At the end it tells who won the game , ie who picks the last stick lost the game.
